  <b>About the Movie: "Reality"</b> <br><br>
  In a world where identity is everything, Reality plunges audiences into the harrowing journey of a man whose seemingly perfect life unravels when he discovers his place in society is nothing more than a fabrication. Directed by Owen O'Brien and featuring a stellar cast, including Chris Rock, Chris Pratt, Jack Black, and a special appearance by Tom Cruise, the film explores the fragile line between illusion and truth. As the protagonist delves deeper into the mystery of his existence, he must confront unsettling questions: Who created his reality, and why? Thought-provoking and visually stunning, Reality is a dystopian thriller that challenges viewers to examine their own perceptions of self and society. Coming to theaters September 29thâ€”are you ready to discover the truth?</p>
